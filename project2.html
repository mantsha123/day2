            Abdul Kalam, one of the greatest Indians of all times who made the nation proud with his
            contribution towards space research as an aerospace scientist. He kept inspiring children to
            dream and think big in life. In 2002, he became the 11th President of India and his tenure lasted
            till 2007. APJ Abdul Kalam was born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu. We
            celebrate his birthday as "World Students’ Day." A Brief Overview of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam as a
            PresidentIn the year 2002, he was appointed as the 11th president of India and served the
            country for the next 5 years. In his book “India 2020: A vision of the new Millennium” he
            proposed a plan which he named “Technology Vision 2020”, which was prepared in the
            mid-1990s. Kalam was a man who greatly contributed to the technological development of India.
            He proposed the countrywide plan known as Technology Vision 2020. In his plan, he suggested
            nuclear empowerment, technological innovations, and increasing the productivity of agriculture.
            His endeavors towards the overall upliftment of our country made him known as the "People's
            President".Dr. Kalam: An Illustrious Life in Science, and TechnologyAbdul Kalam’s Projects for
            ISRO and DRDOKalam greatly contributed to the missile projects namely 'Agni' and 'Prithvi'
            launched by India. Thereafter, he came to be known as the Missile Man of India. He was a
            scientist in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation. In the year 1998, he played a crucial role in the "Pokhran II" nuclear
            test in the country. It was regarded as the second original nuclear test by India. One of the
            must-mention facts about Dr Kalam is that he was the director of India's first Satellite Launch
            Vehicle at ISRO. Dr. Kalam’s Early LifeDr. Kalam's childhood was very tough as the business
            run by his family failed and they lost all sources of income. He was born at a poverty-stricken
            time of his family but managed to overcome all obstacles and worked hard in life to achieve his
            dream. He used to sell newspapers to support his family at a very early age. Even though he
            got average grades in school, his teachers remembered him as a hard-working student with an
            inquisitive mind.APJ Abdul Kalam’s Educational Journey and “Bharat Ratna”Kalam focused
            greatly on mathematics and then after he grew up, he studied physics and aerospace
            engineering in Madras Institute of Technology, from where he passed out in the year 1955.
            When Kalam was in the third year of his graduation, he was given the assignment to build an
            aircraft with a few other selected students. In spite of the teacher pressuring him with a
            hard-core deadline, he completed the project in time and impressed everyone with his creativity.
            This zeal later drove him to become a fighter pilot; however, he ranked 9th in IAF and there
            were only 8 positions available at that time. Nevertheless, Kalam was a multi-talented man. He
            went on to become a scientist, an author, an engineer, a professor, and later, a politician. Before
            he became the 11th President of India, he was the chief scientific advisor to the Prime Minister.
            He received several prestigious awards and was the third President to be honored with India's
            highest civilian award "Bharat Ratna" in the year 1997.
